Repository topic: Mpox Virus (formerly known as Monkeypox Virus) case prevalence and vaccine administration data across the United States (US) per local geography level. 

Repository methodology: The methodology for this repository is primarily data collection. Mpox data was collected by combing US state health department's websites. If mpox data was present at the local level (I.e. County level), then that information was gathered and collected into a single database. Mpox data includes raw case numbers and raw vaccine administration numbers. A total of 32 states and Washington D.C. supplied local level mpox data in some form.
